# Pesonal-Media-Library
Building a PHP-driven page. The true power of PHP shines when you connect it to a data source like an API or a Database. 
This databases, we'll use an example project -- a Personal Media Library application. I'll refactor this project by replacing an associative array with a database 
to provide a more robust and scalable tool to store the data in the media library. In the process, you'll learn how to use PDO -- 
a PHP extension to communicate with a database. Also implement relational databases including how to search for data across multiple tables, 
as well as how to add common web site features like search forms and pagination.
