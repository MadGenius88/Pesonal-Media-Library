# Pesonal-Media-Library

PHP Project

# Synopis
Building a PHP-driven page. The true power of PHP shines when you connect it to a data source like an API or a Database. 
This databases, I am creating a Personal Media Library application. I'll refactor this project by replacing an associative array with a database to provide a more robust and scalable tool to store the data in the media library. In the process, I demonstrared how to use PDO -- a PHP extension to communicate with a database. Also implement relational databases including how to search for data across multiple tables, as well as how to add common web site features like search forms and pagination.
